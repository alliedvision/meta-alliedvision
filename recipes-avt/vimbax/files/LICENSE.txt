      current Software version.
   2. With regard to free Software, we are liable for damages or reimbursement 
      of wasted expenditures only in the event of intentional wrongdoing or

      physical injury or damage to health or the loss of freedom and claims

      claim arose and the obligee becomes aware of the circumstances resulting 
      in the claim and of the identity of the obligor or could have become 
      aware thereof, had there not been gross negligence. The claims will come 
      under the statute of limitations no later than five (5) years after the 
      date on which the claim arises. In the event of claims based on intentional 
      wrongdoing, gross negligence, malice, personal injuries and under the 
      Product Liability Act, the provisions of the statute of limitations 
      shall apply.
